Collections Framework

* The Java Collection Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable
collection of data structures
* For example lists, queues, maps
* The Collection framework was designed and developed mainly by Joshua Bloch, and it was introduced
in JDK 1.2
* We do not have to implement every algorithm and data structures from scratch - these collections 
have been tested
* Almost all the collections (except for map) can be derived from java.util.Collection interface
* The toArray() method can transform any Collection into a one-dimensional array
* The Collection interface extends the java.lang.iterable interface - this is why we can use
for-each loop
